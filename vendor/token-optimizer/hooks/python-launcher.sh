# On Windows (Git Bash/MSYS), python.exe is a console-subsystem binary: each
# hook invocation allocates a transient console window (the "flash") and can
# orphan a conhost.exe. pythonw.exe is the GUI-subsystem twin shipped beside
# it by python.org; launching it allocates no console. We prefer pythonw.exe
# at EXEC time (not discovery time) so a stale cache record that still names
# python.exe does not keep flashing forever -- the cache key is unchanged, so
# the swap must happen on every exec, in both _exec_cached_interpreter and
# _exec_discovered_interpreter.
#
# Constraints (each is a real failure mode, not paranoia):
#   * Same directory only: pythonw.exe must sit next to the resolved
#     python.exe (same install, same version). We never synthesise a path
#     from PATH.
#   * Skip WindowsApps: a Microsoft Store pythonw AppExecutionAlias exits
#     silently outside an interactive token (see measure.py).
#   * stdout must be a pipe, not a tty: pythonw is GUI-subsystem. When its
#     std handles are not valid pipes, CPython sets sys.stdout/sys.stderr to
#     None and the hook protocol goes dark while the process exits 0 -- the
#     top regression for this change. A tty on fd 1 means a console is
#     already attached (no flash to avoid) AND pythonw could null it, so we
#     keep python.exe there. The hook context always provides a pipe, which
#     pythonw inherits intact.
#   * Non-Windows is a strict no-op: the MSYS guard short-circuits before any
#     filesystem probe, so POSIX behaviour is byte-for-byte unchanged.
#   * py.exe (the `py -3` launcher) swaps to pyw.exe in the same directory
#     (#107): pyw.exe is the GUI-subsystem launcher twin and `pyw -3` execs
#     pythonw.exe. Every other guard (same-dir, safe prefix, WindowsApps
#     skip, tty check, liveness probe) applies to pyw.exe unchanged.
#
# Sets _PYW_INTERP to the chosen interpreter (pythonw.exe when swapped, else
# the input unchanged). Selection never fails -- on any doubt we keep the
# caller's interpreter, so this can only ever opt INTO pythonw, never block
# an exec. Uses a variable (not stdout) so the [ -t 1 ] guard sees the

# F2 (#107): decide whether a WindowsApps candidate is a real Store install
# or a dead AppExecutionAlias stub -- WITHOUT flashing a console window on
# the common path. The old probe ran the console-subsystem `python.exe
# --version` on every cache miss, which is exactly the flash this launcher
# exists to prevent.
#
# Design (revised for #143): the CANDIDATE ITSELF must supply POSITIVE PROOF
# OF LIFE by writing a marker to a temp file whose content we then require. A
# dead AppExecutionAlias stub exits without writing it. We do NOT trust a bare
# exit code (a dead alias can exit 0 silently, see measure.py), and we do NOT
# trust a sibling "twin" (pythonw.exe): #143 proved that in WindowsApps each
# alias name is claimed independently, so a LIVE pythonw twin can sit beside a
# DEAD python3.exe from a different package -- the old twin probe then cached
# and exec'd the dead stub on every hook. Only the candidate's own liveness
# decides now.
#
# Flash tradeoff (was #107's concern): the twin was GUI-subsystem, so probing
# it never flashed a console; probing the console candidate directly can flash
# a window ONCE on a cache miss. That regression is accepted deliberately -- a
# silently-dead cached interpreter breaks EVERY hook for affected users, which
# is far worse than a one-time flash that only occurs on the rare cache-miss
# path (the result is cached immediately after). The old code already ran the
# console candidate directly in its `--version` fallback, so invoking the
# candidate here is not a new class of behavior.
#
# Two-tier ladder (both key on the CANDIDATE, never a twin):
#   Tier 1 -- write-marker: candidate writes "ok" via -c -> alive (fast positive).
#   Tier 2 -- --version OUTPUT (not exit code): a live interpreter prints
#     "Python X.Y.Z"; a dead redirector exits 0 but prints a localized "not found /
#     install from Store" message with no version number. Matching the version
#     STRING is what makes this safe -- trusting the bare exit code was the original
#     false-pass. Tier 2 both (a) rescues a live interpreter that could not write the
#     marker (AV-blocked or unwritable temp, cold start, cygpath path mismatch) and
#     (b) rejects a dead stub that reached here because Tier 1 could not run. There
#     is no remaining exit-code-only fallback, so no surviving Store-stub false-pass.
#
# The temp path is handed to the candidate as a native Windows path via cygpath
# when available, so the probe is immune to MSYS argv path-conversion settings
# (MSYS_NO_PATHCONV). Probe stdin comes from /dev/null so the hook's real stdin
# is never consumed. C6 timeout semantics (2s budget, SIGKILL escalation 1s
# after SIGTERM) apply to the probe and the fallback. Strict POSIX no-op is
# preserved: this function is only reached for paths matching
# _path_contains_windowsapps, exactly like the old inline probe.
